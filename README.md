phpSocial's 3200+ legitimate owners can find plugins, themes, and community help here.


### Team Up
Whether you're a developer or owner of phpSocial - there's no reason to be alone anymore - register today - it's free.
As a developer as you can see already 3200+ admins baught a legal license for phpSocial so there are enough people out there looking for plugins and themes for phpSocial. Not to mention the thousands of crooks running phpSocial as warez, which we personally don't like to see - developers like Lunation should be supported by at least buying a standard license for ridiculous S19 only that's a super fair and advantageous price dont you think so.


## It`s easy to contribute
phpSocial was not only developed to offer great performance on all types of servers, including shared ones, with minimum requirements, but it offers 3rd party developers also a easy, smart and very structured way to get their job done. To start developing you can download the ready made DeveloperKit from: https://phpSocial-net.com


### To contribute you need

- a standard license of phpSocial if you want to develop free pluigins & themes - S19 one time fee

Note: Because we phpSocial-Net.com already baught a standard license of phpSocial for our Domain and we invite all our free plugin / theme contributors into our team there is no need for you to buy a extra license of phpSocial. Only if you plan to offer your plugin / theme with your own installation of phpSocial on your very own domain, then you need to buy phpSocial, but as long as you offer it only with us on our domain everything is free for you.

- a extended license of phpSocial if you want to sell your plugins or themes - S99 one time fee

Note: if you plan to sell plugins or themes as a paid premium product you have to buy a extended license of phpSocial. We phpSocial-Net.com only have a standard license of phpSocial, so you can offer free plugins / themes under our domain with no extra costs, but we dont have a premium extended license for phpSocial so thats up to you to buy one if you want to sell paid plugins / themes for phpSocial.
